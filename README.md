# UnnaturalSelection
Reupload of a project I collaborated on for CMPM 146. Collaborated with Erica Nguyen, Dana Popovsky, and William Woosley.

The project was a a text-based game which pitted a player-controlled species against multiple AI species (powered by behavior trees with some randomly generated parameters to create variety). It utilized the Lokta-Volterra predator-prey model to calculate predation, which was then adjusted according to species specific traits and change species' populations accordingly. Players and AI would select traits for their species to acquire using a point-based currency, to simulate a species adapting and evolving over time. More information can be found in the .pdf write-up, which was submitted along with the project for the class.
